### Inspiration
Software developers often find it hard to choose between different github libraries to use for their tasks. Choosing the wrong tools can cost a lot of development time and effort.

### What it does
GithubRadar carefullly investigates github repositories and compare them based on calculated metrics so that users can judge each repositories and choose the right tool for their use.

### How we built it
GithubRadar was built using Nodejs, vuejs and d3.js library all running on docker.

### What we learned
I (Duc) learned how to run a docker environment and using d3.js and vue.js

### What's next for GithubRadar
